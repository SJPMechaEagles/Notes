# Notes
Important notes for correctly programing a VEX cortex

## Printing and Terminal
By: Fred Lu
  + Before uploading code to a cortex, close (control-c) the [pros terminal].
  + To receive the [printf] messages on the [pros terminal], upload any project to the cortex from [Atom].
    The upload itself won't work because the pros terminal is open, but it will enable the cortex so that it can send [printf]
    messages through your currently open [pros terminal].
