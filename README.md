# Notes
Important notes for correctly programing a VEX cortex

## Printing and Terminal
By: Fred Lu
  + Before uploading code to a cortex, close (control-c) the [pros terminal].
  + To receive the [printf] messages on the [pros terminal], upload any project to the cortex from [Atom].
    The upload itself won't work because pros terminal is open, but it activates the cortex so that can send [printf] messages
    through your currently open [pros terminal].
